## 🧠 Design Rationale & Process

> **Approach:** Build a working baseline first, then layer polish and motion—always checking the whole page feels cohesive, fast, and premium.

1. **Prototype (make it work):**  
   Set up core components, routing, and a video-ready hero so the page functioned end-to-end before styling surprises.

2. **Structure (divide the page):**  
   Clear sections—Hero, Search, Featured, Events, Testimonials, Footer—with consistent spacing, radii, and borders to form a glassy system.

3. **Motion pass (give life to each section):**  
   Kinetic headline and parallax in the hero, magnetic red CTA with sheen, gentle form feedback, springy calendar popover, tilt cards with gradient legibility, and calm Ken Burns showcases.

4. **Holistic polish (make it one system):**  
   Color hierarchy (brand red for actions), type rhythm, soft glass surfaces, and restrained motion so interactions feel intentional—not noisy.

## 🎨 Design Principles
- **Cinematic, but usable:** motion directs attention; forms stay minimal.  
- **Consistent language:** same radii, borders, and glass surfaces across modules.  
- **Readable contrast:** video underlays + subtle overlays keep copy crisp.  
- **Performance-aware:** reduced-motion fallbacks; light, purposeful effects.
